**Introduction** 
Linux is a community of open-source Unix like operating systems that are based on the Linux Kernel. Released by Linus Torvalds.It is a free and open-source operating system and the source code can be modified and distributed to anyone commercially or noncommercially under the GNU General Public License. 
Initially, Linux was created for personal computers and gradually it was used in other machines like servers, mainframe computers, supercomputers, etc. Nowadays, Linux is also used in embedded systems like routers, automation controls, televisions, digital video recorders, video game consoles, smartwatches, etc. The biggest success of Linux is Android(operating system) it is based on the Linux kernel that is running on smartphones and tablets.

***Architecture Description:***
-**Kernel** - Kernel is the core of the Linux based operating system.

-**System Library** - It is the special types of functions that are used to implement the functionality of the operating system.

-**Shell** - It is an interface to the kernel which hides the complexity of the kernel’s functions from the users.
             It takes commands from the user and executes the kernel’s functions.
             
-**Hardware Layer** - This layer consists all peripheral devices like RAM/ HDD/ CPU etc.

-**System Utility** - It provides the functionalities of an operating system to the user.
